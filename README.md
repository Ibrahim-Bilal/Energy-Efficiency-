# Energy-Efficiency 
# Problem Statement 
Electrical energy consumption has been increasing over the years as more entities are being electrified day by day. Statistics show that One-Third of the energy produced is consumed by Buildings, where people spend most of their time. With the increasing demand for energy globally, there is a need for efficient use of the energy supplied especially in buildings.
The dataset includes features such as surface/wall/roof area, glass area, glass area distribution, and orientation of 768 simulated building shapes. Based on this data, it is aimed to estimate the heating and cooling load of the building. In this age where environmental awareness is very important, it can be a super consultancy initiative to reduce our carbon footprint, as we still haven't switched to renewable energy sources. This study looked into assessing the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency) as a function of building parameters.
# TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE
Develop a machine learning model to predict cooling energy consumption in residential buildings.
# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF USING HEATING AND COOLING ENERGY CONSUMPTION PREDICTION MODEL
The use of predictive models for energy consumption can help in optimal sizing of the cooling and heating system in a building thereby improving energy efficiency.
•	Energy Savings: Properly sized heating/cooling systems operate at higher efficiencies, resulting in energy savings and reduced operating costs.
•	Reduced Wear and Tear: Oversized systems often cycle on and off more frequently, which can lead to increased wear and tear on equipment. Right-sizing prevents this issue.
•	Comfort: Systems that are too large may lead to temperature swings and discomfort for occupants. Predictive modeling can help avoid this by ensuring that the system is appropriately sized to maintain consistent comfort.
